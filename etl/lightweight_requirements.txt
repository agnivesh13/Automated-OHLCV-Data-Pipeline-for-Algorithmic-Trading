# Lightweight ETL requirements - NO heavy libraries
# Only uses stdlib + boto3 (already available in Lambda runtime)

# boto3 is included in Lambda runtime - no need to package
# Uses only:
# - json (stdlib)
# - csv (stdlib) 
# - gzip (stdlib)
# - datetime (stdlib)
# - typing (stdlib)
# - io (stdlib)

# No pandas, no pyarrow, no fastparquet needed!
